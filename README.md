### Welcome to my github repository

I mostly work with [:snake:](https://www.python.org/), but I am also experienced in Ruby, Go, Powershell and C#. I work as a Full-Time DevOps engineer for a big company, and I try to better the environment on a daily basis, apart from this I like to learn new technologies and I am a competent problem solver.
